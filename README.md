## Problem statement

The applications of Deep Neural Nets is on a roll. Whether it is healthcare, transportation, or retail, companies across all industries are excited about investing in building intelligent solutions. Meanwhile, letâ€™s hope human intelligence remains uncontested.

In this challenge, you will help one of the largest retailers in Germany improve their inventory-management process in its Food and Groceries business. The company is looking for intelligent solutions that can reduce the amount of human effort in its warehouse and retail outlets.

A solution such as a powerful image classifier can help the company track shelf inventory, categorize products, record product volume etc.

You are required to predict the category of each product.

## Solution
Given that the provided groceries dataset shares many similarities with images in the ImageNet dataset, I used a pre-trained InvisionV3 model, adapted with transfer learning and fine tuning.

This led to a prediction score of 0.65777 on the test version of the dataset.
